"Project Clearpath" is an autonomous robot designed for disaster site cleanup, capable of identifying, localizing, and prioritizing hazardous debris. It autonomously navigates sites, detecting debris types, estimating 3D locations, and assigning priority based on hazard level.
This repository contains deliverables for midterm project of Bhavana B Rao, Sriramprasad Kothapalli and Tathya Bhatt as a part of the course ENPM700: Software Development for Robotics at the University of Maryland.
